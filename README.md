# Demand Forecasting in Supply Chain Management

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for **Lab 5.1: Demand Forecasting in Supply Chain Management**, demonstrating techniques for predicting future product demand using machine learning models.

## 📚 Project Description

Accurate demand forecasting is critical for efficient supply chain management. In this lab, we explore:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Building forecasting models
- Model evaluation and visualization

The objective is to develop predictive models that help businesses plan inventory, reduce costs, and optimize their supply chain operations.
